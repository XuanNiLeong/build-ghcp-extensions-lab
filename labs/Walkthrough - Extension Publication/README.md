### Step 1: Changing the Visibility of Your Copilot Extension

After building your Copilot Extension, to prepare your extension for the Marketplace is to make it public. This allows anyone with the link to your app's installation page to install it. To change the visibility of your Copilot Extension, follow these steps:

1. In the upper-right corner of GitHub, click your profile photo and select **Your organizations**.
2. Under "Organizations," next to your organization name, click **Settings**.
3. At the bottom of the sidebar, select **Developer settings**, then click **GitHub Apps**.
4. Next to your Copilot Extension, click **Edit**.
5. In the sidebar, click **Advanced**. 
6. At the bottom of the "Danger Zone" section, choose one of the following options:
   - **Make public**: Your GitHub App is currently private, and only the organization or user who created it can install it. Click **Make public** to allow anyone with the link to your app's installation page to install it.
7. If your app is public, you can share the link to your installation page by clicking **Public page** in the sidebar and copying the link.

### Step 2: Listing Your Copilot Extension on the GitHub Marketplace

To list your Copilot Extension on the GitHub Marketplace, follow these steps:

1. Once the app is public...
2. Scroll down to the **Marketplace** section and click **List in Marketplace**. This option is only visible if your app is public.

3. In the **Listing name** textbox, type a name for your listing. The name should follow one of these conventions:
   - YOUR-PRODUCT-NAME (example: "Copilot")
   - YOUR-COMPANY-NAME (example: "GitHub")
   - YOUR-COMPANY-PRODUCT-NAME (example: "GitHub Copilot")

4. In the **Primary category** section, select a category from the dropdown menu.

5. Fill out all the required sections for your listing.
6. Verify that the organization account that owns the GitHub App is a verified publisher on the GitHub Marketplace.
   - If your organization is not yet verified, follow the steps to apply for publisher verification.
7. Accept the **GitHub Marketplace Developer Agreement**.

Once these steps are completed, click **Submit for review**.

### Step 4: GitHub Marketplace Review Process

After submitting your extension, GitHub will review it to ensure it meets the quality, performance, reliability, and security standards. If your submission is approved, it will be listed on the GitHub Marketplace. If your submission is denied, GitHub will provide feedback, and you can address any issues before resubmitting.

### Conclusion

In this lab, you learned how to manage the visibility of your Copilot Extension and list it on the GitHub Marketplace. This will enable others to discover and install your extension.
